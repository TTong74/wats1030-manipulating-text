My favorite text editor would have to be emacs. Although I spent the most time trying to figure out how to complete the assignment with it, as opposed to the other editors, it ended up being my favorite. I was able to find a tips and tricks page that helped out a lot. What I like most about emacs for this assignment was the functionality with searching for word occurences (M-x count-matches) and replacing strings (M-x replace-string). Nano would probably be my second favorite because of the layout at the bottom of the editor with the shortcuts, Which puts Vi at the bottom of my list. Vi wasn't terribly difficult to use but I just didn't like the shortcuts that were used for certain actions, such as the string replacement (:%s/old/new/g). Here's a link to the tips and tricks for emacs that I used: https://users-cs.au.dk/~chili/PBI/emacs.
